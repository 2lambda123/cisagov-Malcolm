# <a name="NetBox"></a>Asset Management with NetBox

Malcolm provides an instance of [NetBox](https://netbox.dev/), an open-source "solution for modeling and documenting modern networks." The NetBox web interface is available at at [https://localhost/netbox/](https://localhost/netbox/) if you are connecting locally.

The design of a potentially deeper integration between Malcolm and Netbox is a [work in progress](https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm/issues/131).

Please see the [NetBox page on GitHub](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox), its [documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/) and its [public demo](https://demo.netbox.dev/) for more information.

## <a name="NetBoxPopPassive"></a>Populate NetBox inventory via passively-gathered network traffic metadata

The purpose of an asset management system is to document the intended state of a network: were Malcolm to actively and agressively populate NetBox with the live network state, a network configuration fault could result in an incorrect documented configuration. The Malcolm development team is investigating what data, if any, should automatically flow to NetBox based on traffic observed (enabled via the `NETBOX_CRON` [environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`](malcolm-config.md#DockerComposeYml)), and what NetBox inventory data could be used, if any, to enrich Malcolm's network traffic metadata. Well-considered suggestions in this area are welcome.

See [idaholab/Malcolm#135](https://github.com/idaholab/Malcolm/issues/135).

## <a name="NetBoxBackup"></a>Backup and Restore

Currently the NetBox database must be backed up and restored manually using `docker-compose`. While Malcolm is running, run the following command from within the Malcolm installation directory to backup the entire NetBox database:

```
$ docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) netbox-postgres pg_dump -U netbox -d netbox | gzip > netbox_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).psql.gz
```

To clear the existing NetBox database and restore a previous backup, run the following commands (substituting the filename of the `netbox_â€¦.psql.gz` you wish to restore) from within the Malcolm installation directory while Malcolm is running:

```
$ docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) netbox-postgres dropdb -U netbox netbox --force

$ docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) netbox-postgres createdb -U netbox netbox

$ gunzip < netbox_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).psql.gz | docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) -T netbox-postgres psql -U netbox

$ docker-compose exec -u $(id -u) netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/manage.py migrate
```

Note that some of the data in the NetBox database is cryptographically signed with the value of the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable in the `./netbox/env/netbox.env` environment file. A restored NetBox backup **will not work** if this value is different from when it was created.
